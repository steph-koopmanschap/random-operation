This program takes 2 numbers and performs a random operation on the 2 numbers and then returns its value.

The goal of this program is to make the user not know what is happening with their numbers. :)
This function can be combined with other programs to create fun weird randomness and unexpected behaviors in complex calculations. :D

The program will ranomdly select one of these 5 operations to perform:

addition: 
num1 + num2

subtraction 
num1 - num2

multiplication
num1 * num2

division
num1 / num2

to the power of
num1^num2

random range
Select random integer between num1 and num2
